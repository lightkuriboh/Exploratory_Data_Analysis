### Project to explore data from America's National Emissions Inventory on PM2.5 pollution matter  

### The six questions for six corresponding plots are:  
* Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?  
* Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008?  
* Of the four types of sources indicated by the \color{red}{\verb|type|}type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?  
* Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?  
* How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?  
* Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
